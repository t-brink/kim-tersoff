This model driver is based on the LAMMPS implementation of the Tersoff
potential.

For information about the parameter file and the form of the potential
see http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_tersoff.html for now.

The core part of energy/force calculation is adapted from code in
LAMMPS.  LAMMPS is licensed under GPLv2, which then also applies to
the whole model driver.  See the LICENSE file for details.
