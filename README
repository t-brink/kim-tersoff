This model driver is based on the LAMMPS implementation of the Tersoff
potential.  LAMMPS is available at http://lammps.sandia.gov/.

For information about the parameter file and the form of the potential
see http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_tersoff.html for now. In
addition to a LAMMPS-compatible parameter file, a settings file is
also required. For now, it must just list all used particle types as
space-separated chemical symbols on the first line.

The core part of energy/force calculation is adapted from code in
LAMMPS.  LAMMPS is licensed under GPLv2, which then also applies to
the whole model driver.  See the LICENSE file for details.

The directory "helpers" contains a python script to convert different
variants of Tersoff-type potentials to the input file format expected
by this model driver (and LAMMPS).  There are also some example input
files for the script.

Thanks to Mingjian Wen for adding process_dEdr support.
