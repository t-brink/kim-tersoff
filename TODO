* Benchmark with and w/o ZBL and find the reason why this is so much slower
  via KIM. Therefore, make 1000 random atoms, calculate energy/force 1000
  times; no neighbor list recalc or anything else!

    * LAMMPS native (make sure to calculate pe/atom!)

    * LAMMPS + KIM

    * mytest + KIM

    * hacked together to bypass KIM with my code
